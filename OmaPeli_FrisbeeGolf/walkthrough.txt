**Instructions**
****************

The goal of this game is to play the disc golf course and reach a score of even or under par (12). 
If you don’t reach the goal, get injured or quit the game, you won’t win.

There are random events in the game, which occurs with a chance of 1/10 during each throw. 
Some of these events will increase your confidence, which increases your chances of completing harder shots (i.e. hole in one). 
Some of them can take you further on the fairway. You can also increase your confidence by practicing in each of the practice areas.

After entering the first tee of the course, you cannot go back. You can only advance forward in the course.

In the beginning, you have 3 discs in your bag: aviar (putter), md3 (approach disc) and destroyer (distance driver). 
Before each throw you have to select a disc which you throw. After selecting, you can throw the disc with the given throwing styles. After each throw, one throw is added to your score. 

In some of the cases, selecting a different disc or a different throwing style has different output (disc lands into a lake or it’s a fairway hit). 
It also depends on the current confidence level, which varies between -2 to 5.


***************
**Walkthrough**
***************


Note that this walkthrough assumes that you finish the practice area with +3 confidence points. 
If you don’t want to do the practice area but want to follow this walkthrough, then add +3 to def confidenceBoost in the code.

Also, it’s possible that your putts miss and then you have to rethrow. This is happening with a possibility of; succes: (4 + confidence)/10 fail: 1 - succes. 
And it’s also possible that if you have high enough confidence and disc selection you can throw hole in one for example. If random event occurs, you can skip it by ignoring it or doing it by following the guidance in the UI.
